Trading with cftc's institutional reports

---

## Context
The [commodity futures and trading commission](https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/index.htm) generates weekly [COT](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cot.asp) (commitment of traders) reports that showcase position of comercial and non comercial institutions on a given commodity or equity. The COT reports have information about how many long and short positions were open on a given commodity or equity, they also include the change of long and short positions from one report to an other.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create machine-learning and deep-learning models that can predict the short term price movement of an equity or commodity in order to trade an specific financial instrument for profit.
